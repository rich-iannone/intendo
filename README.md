The **intendo** R package is pretty much a dataset package but there are some twisty
twists in here too. There are four datasets available that track the performance 
of the *Super Jetroid* mobile game. *On top of that* there are messed up versions
of those datasets. Just totally riddled with all sorts of data problems. We call them
'faulty' and, yeah, they really are.

As it turns out, this is great. You can choose to practice your data skills with 100% 
Grade A data that conforms to the highest standards of data cleanliness, or, you can
challenge yourself with cleaning up the bad datasets. The data is medium-large in size
there is yet another set of analogous data that is even larger.

Aside from providing some interesting datasets, this package intends to get a little
*experimental* with data documentation. I mean, wouldn't it be great to have top-notch
information on the data at your fingertips? To this end, the package supplies data
dictionaries for each of datasets contained herein. If you discover them and like what
you see then you learn how to make your own. Then, with this new superpower (and it
really is a superpower) you can educate and delight your data compatriots in equal 
measure.
