Description: This package contains four datasets from the 'Intendo' game
    called Super Jetroid. It is data from the 2015 year and it comprises a
    revenue table, a user summary table, a daily users table, and a table with
    all user sessions. There are also datasets that are intentionally made
    faulty. This makes them useful for testing with data validation packages
    (all faultiness is throughly documented).
