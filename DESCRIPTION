Description: This package provides four datasets from the 'Intendo' game
    'Super Jetroid'. It is data from the 2015 year of operation and it comprises
    a revenue table ('all_revenue'), a daily users table ('users_daily'), a user
    summary table ('user_summary'), and a table with data on all user sessions
    ('all_sessions'). These core datasets come in different sizes, and, each of
    them has a variant that was intentionally made faulty (totally riddled with
    errors and inconsistencies). This suite of tables is useful for testing with
    packages that focus on data validation and data documentation.
