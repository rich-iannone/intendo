Description: This package contains quite a few datasets from the 'Intendo' Game
    Studio game called Super Jetroid. It's just 2015 data and it comprises a
    revenue table, a user summary table, a daily users table, and a table with
    all user sessions. Here's the interesting thing: there are also parallel
    datasets that are faulty. This makes them useful for testing with data
    validation packages (all faultiness is throughly documented).
