Description: This package provides four datasets from the 'Intendo' game
    'Super Jetroid'. It is data from the 2015 year of operation and it comprises
    a revenue table, a user summary table, a daily users table, and a table with
    data on all user sessions. These core datasets come in different sizes, and,
    each of those has a variant that was intentionally made faulty (just riddled
    with errors and inconsistencies). This suite of tables is thus useful for
    testing with packages that focus on data validation and data documentation.
